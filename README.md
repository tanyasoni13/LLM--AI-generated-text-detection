# LLM--AI-generated-text-detection

Our project aims to tackle the issue to identify and flag AI-generated text segments by leveraging the power of BERT.
After preprocessing the data and utilizing the BERT tokenizer, I encoded the preprocessed text, preparing it for input into our detection model.
Using a BERT-based sequence classification model,  trained the system to distinguish between genuine and AI-generated text with a high degree of accuracy.
